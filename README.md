## What is it?

It's a work-in-progress game that involves Paper Delivery.

Currently not compatible with Mobile Devices. 

You'll want a device with a keyboard + mouse or dual-stick gamepad to play.

Created in the Godot Engine utilizing it's 'GDScript' language (similar to Python). Heavily based on learnings from HeartBeast's 1-Bit Godot Course:  [https://courses.heartgamedev.com/p/1-bit-godot-course-by-heartbeast](https://courses.heartgamedev.com/p/1-bit-godot-course-by-heartbeast)

## HOW TO PLAY: TIPS

	If you miss a mailbox, it's game over - unless you deliver another paper within 5 seconds!
	Even if you recover and deliver another paper within 5 seconds of missing, game ends after last paper is gone.
	Score multipliers are applied based on your distance to the mailboxes!
	Try to deliver two papers within one second, a point multiplier will be applied!
