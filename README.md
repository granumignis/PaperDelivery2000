# PAPER DELIVERY 2000

## What is it?

It's a work-in-progress / prototype game that involves Paper Delivery.

Currently not compatible with Mobile Devices. 

You'll want a device with a keyboard + mouse or dual-stick gamepad (preferred) to play.

Created in the Godot Engine utilizing it's 'GDScript' language (similar to Python). 

Heavily based on learnings from HeartBeast's 1-Bit Godot Course:  [https://courses.heartgamedev.com/p/1-bit-godot-course-by-heartbeast](https://courses.heartgamedev.com/p/1-bit-godot-course-by-heartbeast)

## HOW TO PLAY: INPUT

Keyboard 

	Arrow keys or WASD keys to move

Mouse

	Move cursor  to change Aim Direction
	Left click to throw a newspaper
	

Dual Stick GamePad (Tested on Xbox 360 Controller)

	Left Stick Moves
	Right Stick Changes Aim Direction
	Throw a newspaper with the'A' button (bottom face button) or right trigger

## HOW TO PLAY: VISUALS

	That 'red arc shape' near your character indicates (roughly) where you are currently aiming
	The thing you are throwing is a newspaper
	Those white box/post things around you are special 'newspaper delivery' boxes


## HOW TO PLAY: TIPS

	If you throw a paper and it misses a box, it's game over - unless you deliver another paper within 5 seconds!
	Even if you recover and deliver another paper within 5 seconds of missing, game ends after last paper is gone.
	Score multipliers are applied based on your distance to the box!
	Try to deliver two papers within one second, a point multiplier will be applied!
	You only get 6 papers, but if you throw rapidly - you might somehow throw a few more! (yes, this is a bug)
