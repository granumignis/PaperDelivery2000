Little flow tweaks:


Test 1: Win straight up
=======
Make it so you know where all of the mailboxes are
Return to Title Screen when you win (just like test 2)
Make it so pressing ESC or Start takes you to a pause menu


Test 2: Miss a paper and wait 6 seconds
=======
Make the losing text appear in a different way, multi line text - more concise font




Test 3: Miss a paper and recover
=======
make the 'you lost' proceedings happen faster
Return to Title Screen when you lose (just like test 2)


Test 4: Lose straight up
=======
Return to Title Screen when you lose (just like test 2)
